<h2 style ="font-size: 22px;"> Splash Screen Page </h2> <h2> The splash screen page is the first page of the website. It includes the website mission, group members and has a redirection implemented in the meta section of the code, so that after 4 seconds the page redirects to the home page created by Student 2. It also has a animated image to show that the website is loading/will redirect. </h2> <br>

<h2 style ="font-size: 22px;"> Shop Page </h2> <h2> The shop page includes a product showcase, product options, product selection, order summary (basket), checkout summary and checkout system feedback. I created 3 different things you could add to cart. These insisted of HIV Donations, Malaria Donations and Reproductive Health Care Service Donations. This was to fit the theme of the website we chose from the United Nations website which was "Good Health and Well-Being". I used a select so the user can choose how much they want to donate, and a button so they could add to cart and checkout. Java script was used for the checkout section and to make the buttons and select usable.  </h2> <br>

<h2 style ="font-size: 22px;"> Content Page </h2> <h2> The content page revolved around our groups chosen them of "Good Health and Well-Being". I included images and long text. To make sure that the user can easily navigate the page I included anchors at the top and bottom which allows the user to easily go to the top or bottom because of the long text. </h2> <br>
